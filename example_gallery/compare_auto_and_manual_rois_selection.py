Find Regions of interest (ROIs) in a spectrogram
================================================

A spectrogram is a time-frequency (2d) representation of a audio recording. 
Each acoustic event nested in the audio recording is represented by an acoustic
signature. When sounds does not overlap in time and frequency, it is possible
to extract automatically the acoustic signature as a region of interest (ROI) 
by different image processing tools such as binarization, double thresholding,
mathematical morphology tools...

Dependencies: To execute this example you will need to have installed the 
scikit-image, scikit-learn and pandas Python packages.

# Then, relevant acoustic events are extracted directly from the power 
# spectrogram based on a double thresholding technique. The result is binary
# image called a mask. Double thresholding technique is more sophisticated than
# basic thresholding based on a single value. First, a threshold selects pixels
# with high value (i.e. high acoustic energy). They should belong to an acoustic
# event. They are called seeds. From these seeds, we aggregate pixels connected
# to the seed with value higher than the second threslhold. These new pixels 
# become seed and the aggregating process continue until no more new pixels are
# aggregated, meaning that there is no more connected pixels with value upper 
# than the second threshold value.
