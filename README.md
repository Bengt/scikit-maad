**scikit-maad** is a free, open-source and modular toolbox to **analyze ecoacoustics datasets** in Python 3. This package was designed to bring flexibility to (1) **find regions of interest**, and (2) to compute **acoustic features** in audio recordings. This workflow opens the possibility to use powerfull **machine learning** algorithms through **scikit-learn**, allowing to identify key patterns in all kind of soundscapes.

## About the authors
This work started in 2016 at the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN) in Paris, France. It was initiated by [Juan Sebastian Ulloa](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Juan_Ulloa), supervised by Jérôme Sueur and Thierry Aubin at the [Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle](http://isyeb.mnhn.fr/fr) and the [Université Paris Saclay](http://neuro-psi.cnrs.fr/) respectively. Python functions were added by [Sylvain Haupert](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sylvain_Haupert) and Chloe Huetz in 2018. New features are currently being developped and stable release will be available by the end of 2019.
