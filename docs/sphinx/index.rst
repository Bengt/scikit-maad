**scikit-maad** is a free, open-source and modular toolbox to **analyze ecoacoustics datasets** in Python 3. This package was designed to bring flexibility to (1) **find regions of interest**, and (2) to compute **acoustic features** in audio recordings. This workflow opens the possibility to use powerfull **machine learning** algorithms through **scikit-learn**, allowing to identify key patterns in all kind of soundscapes.
