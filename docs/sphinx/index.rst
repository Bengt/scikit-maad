Welcome to scikit-maad's documentation!
=======================================

**scikit-maad** is a free, open-source and modular toolbox to **analyze 
ecoacoustics datasets** in Python 3. This package was designed to bring 
flexibility to (1) **find regions of interest**, and (2) to compute **acoustic 
features** in audio recordings. This workflow opens the possibility to analyze audio and use 
powerfull **machine learning**, allowing to identify key patterns in all kind of soundscapes.
